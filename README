q2-gpbot-client

Here lies the remnants of an old distributed genetic programming system. The 
idea was to evolve a Quake2 bot. This is the client piece which more or less
worked like this:

1. Contact the GP bot server, receive a generation of bots to simulate
2. Compile each bot's C++ code
3. Launch a quake2 dedicated server to host the competition
4. Launch each compiled bot which then connects to the Q2 server
5. Fight!
6. Upload results to GP bot server, go to #1
